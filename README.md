## Repository

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/takumayumi/freight-booking-summary-card)

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React (Next.js 15)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4
- **TypeScript**: Enabled for better type safety
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML and keyboard navigable controls
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first design using Tailwind's utility classes

## Thought Process

1. **Component Structure**  
   The UI is built as a reusable card component, with clear sections for location, vehicle details, pricing, and actions.

2. **Responsiveness**  
   Tailwind CSS was used to create a layout that adapts seamlessly from mobile to desktop breakpoints.

3. **Accessibility**
   - Used semantic tags: `<section>`, `<button>`, `<dl>` for structured data
   - Buttons include `aria-label`s for screen readers
   - All interactive elements are focusable and keyboard-friendly

4. **Reusability & Maintainability**
   - Component logic is separated into small, readable chunks
   - Props and types are documented
   - Utility-first classes keep styles consistent and maintainable
